# Investigate code and make implementation sugestion. 



**Instructions:**  
New feature that should be implemented:
$ARGUMENT
You make a plan:
* Which classes are affected and which you should inspect for similar code?
* What software design considerations are relevant?
   - Design patterns being used
   - Dependencies and their purposes
   - Key abstractions and interfaces
   - Naming conventions and code organization
* How does the feature integrate into the overall flow of managing knockout observables and setting up the calculator?
* Which new classes and methods need to be added. How can existing code be efficiently be reused?
* Update CLAUDE.md with the captured insights: 
   - Key architectural decisions
   - Important implementation details but avoid lengthy examples. Refer to the code instead.
   - Common patterns used throughout the code
   - Any gotchas or non-obvious behaviors

Important: You do not generate any code yet!
