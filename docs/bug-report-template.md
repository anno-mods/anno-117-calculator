Please report all bugs in English and with appropriate description (see examples below). Use the configuration export (top right icon).

> :x: Trade routes do not work
:arrow_right:  One can only guess which aspect does not work. Those bugs cannot be considered and such posts are deleted.

> :ok:  I have noticed a minor issue that when importing from another island, it does not activate the production building on the island you are importing from. It also does not appear that exports are being added to an island's production. Juliana is exporting 0.21t of Mackerel and using 0.31t itself. The calculator is not adding the 0.21 from the other island.
:arrow_right: I can likely find the problem and fix it. But since I do not have the same setup (island Juliana) it might take me longer or the bug does not occur.

> :white_check_mark:  Do the following:
> 1. Load the attached configuration (the correct island is already selected)
> 2. Open Mackerel production dialog
> 3. Open trade tab.
> 4. Select "Juliana" as island
> 5. Click the "obtain goods from" button
> 6. Switch to the  Mackerel production dialog of Juliana
> 7. No trade route is shown (but there should be the newly created one).
:arrow_right:  Steps 1 to 4 prepare the setup, step 5 to 6 create the bug. Step 7 shows what differs from expectation. That way I can redo that procedure to make sure I pinpoint and solve the problem.
