# Anno 117: Pax Romana - Gameplay Summary

Anno 117 builds upon the proven Anno formula while introducing Roman-era mechanics and new strategic elements.

**Population Growth & Needs**: Citizens progress through tiers (Plebs, Citizens, Patricians, etc.), each with increasing consumption needs. Higher-tier residents unlock new buildings and provide more tax revenue.

**Production Chains**: Complex interconnected systems where raw materials flow through multiple processing stages to create finished goods. Proper chain optimization is crucial for efficient resource management.

**Island Management**: Each island specializes in different resources based on fertility and deposits. Trade routes connect islands to share resources and balance supply/demand across your empire.
